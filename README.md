# Blank Monitors

A simple application to quickly blank and unblank monitors in a multi-monitor setup, when wanting to focus on some specific app.

Much quicker than turning off monitors or changing monitor profiles, but of course the blanked monitors still consume power.

After you run it once, right click on it in the taskbar and do "Pin to taskbar".

Then you can:
* Click on it in the taskbar of some monitor (or middle-click if already open) to blank that monitor.
* Shift-click on it in the taskbar of some monitor to blank all other monitors
* Double-click on a blank monitor to unblank all monitors
* Right-click on a blank monitor to change the color, enable always-on-top, or blank/unblank specific monitors
* By default, without always-on-top, you can freely alt+tab to apps in blanked monitors, do something in them, then click on the blank background to resume blanking.
